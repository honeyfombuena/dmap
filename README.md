DMaP is a QGIS Plug-in designed to help with Disaster Mapping Prioritization in OpenStreetMap (OSM).
In general, the purpose of this plug-in is to provide technical assistance to communities and individuals who want to map their area but don't know where to start. It aims to improve disaster management decision-making, particularly at the disaster preparedness stage. 

This tool is being developed by the Open Mapping Hub Asia-Pacific and is nearing the end of its first development phase.
We are facilitating test runs from multiple users with the goal of gathering feedback that will help us improve and prepare for Phases 2 and 3 of the development. Please keep in mind that in Phase 2, we will be focusing on providing user flexibility in terms of data inputs and layer weights.
Phase 3 will, on the other hand, be devoted to improving the plugin's UI and UX.
